    <h1>About SEER Search</h1>
    <p class ="about">
    Our Product Owner Peter has a passion for Evidence-based software engineering and wants to support developers decisions about different types of practices based on evidence
    and experience. He believes that there is a lot of evidence documented in Research papers that is unavailable to commercial software engineers due to the papers being behind
    some kind of paywall, written in academic language which might be unfamilar.
